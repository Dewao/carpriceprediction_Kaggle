Car Price Prediction â€“ Personal Regression Project

Overview
This project was developed as part of an academic assignment while pursuing my Masterâ€™s degree in Data Science and Analytics at King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals (KFUPM). It reflects my individual effort to apply and deepen my understanding of regression modeling techniques using real-world data.

Author
This project was solely developed by Dewao. All workâ€”including data cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, model development, and performance evaluationâ€”was completed independently as part of my learning process.

Purpose
The main objectives of this project are to:

Strengthen practical skills in regression techniques (e.g., linear regression, ridge/lasso regression)

Gain hands-on experience working with real datasets

Improve understanding of model evaluation metrics and data preprocessing workflows

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is publicly available on Kaggle and can be accessed at:
ðŸ”— Car Price Prediction Dataset â€“ Kaggle

The dataset includes attributes such as:

Car brand and model

Year of manufacture

Fuel type

Kilometers driven

Transmission type

Selling price

All rights to the dataset belong to the original creator.

Technologies Used
